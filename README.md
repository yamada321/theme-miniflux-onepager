### theme-miniflux-onepager
A light theme for miniflux the RSS reader. 
Tweaks: 

- in default view. one page is one screen, for most screens except for phones.
- in default view, marking an entry as read does not immediately remove it from the visual display (until you move on to other pages). The entry turns gray instead. 
- in item view, category/author/time have bright colors for quick glances.
