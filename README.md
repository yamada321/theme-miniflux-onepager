### theme-miniflux-onepager
A light theme for miniflux the RSS reader. 
Tweaks: 

- in default view, on most displays this should accomodate 7 items per screen (not controlled by css; set this in the user panel).
- in default view, marking an entry as read does not immediately remove it from the visual display, until you move on to other pages. The entry turns gray instead. TODO?: not sure if this changes (un)read behavior, because sometimes i had to flush the history to avoid already-read items in the item view, which seems not the intended behavior. 
- in item view, category/author/time have bright colors for quick glances.
